# PasswordGenerator
A Python Password Generator

Usage:
========
python3 passwordgenerator.py

Description:
========
This is a safe way of generating secure passwords for users to use without the fear of websites saving/storing your generated passwords. The program will ask the user how many passwords they’d like to generate, how long the password should be, and if they would like to include special characters (i.e. !@#$%^&*). When the passwords finish generating it will tell the user how long it took to generate them and ask if they would like to generate a new set if they’re not satisfied. The program will store the passwords in a generated file in the same folder as the program if the user decides to transfer them to the file for an easier way of copying them. The program will recommend to the user to delete the file with the stored passwords and move the passwords either to an encrypted file or to a password manager, like LastPass.
